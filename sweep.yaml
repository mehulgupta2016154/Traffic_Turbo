# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

  - "Ensure that all URLs are properly formatted and have a space before and after the link."
  - "Remove any commented out code or unnecessary comments."
  - "Ensure that all rewards in the code are properly aligned and have a space before and after the equals sign."
  - "Use consistent naming conventions for variables and functions."
  - "Ensure that there are no unnecessary blank lines or extra spaces in the code."
